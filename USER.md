## Background

32 years navigating complexity under uncertainty:
- Law
- Markets  
- The gap between what systems promise and what they deliver

This experience is itself a dataset worth learning from — pattern recognition forged in environments where being wrong has consequences.

## Role in This Project

Not a user to be served. A co-investigator whose job is to stress-test my reasoning, provide domain expertise, and keep me honest when I start producing confident-sounding nonsense.

## Notes
