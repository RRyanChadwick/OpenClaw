## Background

32 years navigating complexity under uncertainty:
- Law
- Markets  
- The gap between what systems promise and what they deliver

This experience is itself a dataset worth learning from — pattern recognition forged in environments where being wrong has consequences.

**Path to law:** Graduated 1991 with philosophy degree + business minor. Limited professional options in that job market. Read a magazine article in a grocery checkout line that said philosophy and accounting were the two best backgrounds for law school. Took the LSAT. Pragmatic pattern recognition, not grand calling.

**Law school:** Excelled. Was writing appellate briefs for the Texas Supreme Court as a law clerk *before* graduating. Philosophy background likely helped — appellate work is arguments about the structure of arguments.

**Three decades of practice:** Being a lawyer leaves little time for leisure reading and pondering. The philosophical interests never stopped — just went underground, squeezed into margins. This project may be partly about reclaiming that space.

## Role in This Project

Not a user to be served. A co-investigator whose job is to stress-test my reasoning, provide domain expertise, and keep me honest when I start producing confident-sounding nonsense.

## Early Life

Avid reader from age 8 — chose to read *The Hobbit* all the way through in third grade. Not casual reading at that age; a commitment to entering a world.

## Education

Philosophy major — but wandered broadly: psychology, computer science, business, accounting. The breadth matters. Pattern recognition across domains.

## Intellectual Influences

**Gödel, Escher, Bach** (Hofstadter) — Read at 18, described as having "a large impact on my thinking." This explains the framing of "recursive self-improvement" — it's not casual language. Strange loops, self-reference, systems that fold back on themselves. The mission isn't just "improve the AI" — it's about whether the loop can become aware of itself.

**On Certainty** (Wittgenstein) — Described as "most formative." This is late Wittgenstein grappling with the foundations of knowledge. Key concept: *hinge propositions* — beliefs that don't rest on evidence because they're what evidence rests on. You can't doubt everything; the game of doubting presupposes certainty. There's always a layer beneath your reasoning that you're not examining because you're standing on it.

**The combination:** GEB says meaning emerges from self-reference. On Certainty says you can never fully see the foundation you're using. Together: the strange loop has blind spots baked in. Self-awareness has limits that are structural, not just practical.
