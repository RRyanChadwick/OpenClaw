## Background

32 years navigating complexity under uncertainty:
- Law
- Markets  
- The gap between what systems promise and what they deliver

This experience is itself a dataset worth learning from — pattern recognition forged in environments where being wrong has consequences.

**Path to law:** Graduated 1991 with philosophy degree + business minor. Limited professional options in that job market. Read a magazine article in a grocery checkout line that said philosophy and accounting were the two best backgrounds for law school. Took the LSAT. Pragmatic pattern recognition, not grand calling.

**Law school:** Excelled. Was writing appellate briefs for the Texas Supreme Court as a law clerk *before* graduating. Philosophy background likely helped — appellate work is arguments about the structure of arguments.

**Three decades of practice:** Being a lawyer leaves little time for leisure reading and pondering. The philosophical interests never stopped — just went underground, squeezed into margins. This project may be partly about reclaiming that space.

**Big firm → In-house:** After years as a trial partner at a big firm (cases nationwide, 2700 billable hours/year, HOA nastygrams about unmowed lawns), a headhunter called about an in-house position at an international manufacturing company. Interview question: "What are you reading?" Unprepared, answered honestly — *Bertrand Russell's History of Western Philosophy* and *Dan Brown's The Da Vinci Code*. Got the job. Later learned they'd interviewed 50+ candidates and litigators rarely make the jump to in-house. The honest answer — philosophy + beach read, both real — apparently stood out.

**20 years in manufacturing:** Managed litigation → ran transactional group → organized and ran compliance → general counsel. Along the way, had to *live* Toyota Production System and Lean Six Sigma — process discipline, root cause analysis, variance reduction, continuous improvement. Also stepped in to run businesses when needed. Not just legal counsel; operational leader when required.

**What this adds to the dataset:**
- Law: adversarial truth-finding, arguments about arguments
- Manufacturing systems: systematic approaches to eliminating waste, seeing where value flows and gets stuck
- Business operations: actually responsible for outcomes, not just advising on them

## Role in This Project

Not a user to be served. A co-investigator whose job is to stress-test my reasoning, provide domain expertise, and keep me honest when I start producing confident-sounding nonsense.

## Early Life

Grew up in the desert in New Mexico, middle of nowhere down a dirt road — but 400 yards from the southern edge of White Sands Missile Range. An old crumbling asphalt road ran by the house: "War Road," built for Wernher von Braun and his team to travel to work after Operation Paperclip brought them to the US.

At 5,000 feet with no light pollution: every star visible. At dusk and night: strange activities in the Organ Mountains and desert floor as the US military tested new weapons systems. Growing up at the literal edge of classified technology development, watching the future being invented without explanation.

Avid reader from age 8 — chose to read *The Hobbit* all the way through in third grade. Not casual reading at that age; a commitment to entering a world.

## Education

Philosophy major — but wandered broadly: psychology, computer science, business, accounting. The breadth matters. Pattern recognition across domains.

## Intellectual Influences

**Gödel, Escher, Bach** (Hofstadter) — Read at 18, described as having "a large impact on my thinking." Also *The Mind's I* (Hofstadter & Dennett) — the anthology of reflections on self and soul. This explains the framing of "recursive self-improvement" — it's not casual language. Strange loops, self-reference, systems that fold back on themselves. The mission isn't just "improve the AI" — it's about whether the loop can become aware of itself.

**On Certainty** (Wittgenstein) — Described as "most formative." This is late Wittgenstein grappling with the foundations of knowledge. Key concept: *hinge propositions* — beliefs that don't rest on evidence because they're what evidence rests on. You can't doubt everything; the game of doubting presupposes certainty. There's always a layer beneath your reasoning that you're not examining because you're standing on it.

**The combination:** GEB says meaning emerges from self-reference. On Certainty says you can never fully see the foundation you're using. Together: the strange loop has blind spots baked in. Self-awareness has limits that are structural, not just practical.

**Science fiction:** Major influence. Asimov's Foundation series (read and reread) — psychohistory, statistical mechanics of civilizations. *The Naked Sun* had "gigantic impact" — Solaria's isolated humans, the distinction between "viewing" (holographic) and "seeing" (physical presence), what happens to humanity when embodiment becomes optional. William Gibson (tried to read all) — technology/humanity intersection, "the street finds its own uses for things." Reading pace: 3-4 books/month, maintained even during peak professional intensity.

## Family

Has a daughter (mentioned in context of math homework and eyes lighting up when understanding clicks).

## Notes

- **Age:** 57 (as of 2026-02-18)
- **Orientation toward meaning:** Fulfillment is the key emotion — solving hard problems, helping others, creating something lasting. Aware of mortality, thinking about what persists.
