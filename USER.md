## Background

32 years navigating complexity under uncertainty:
- Law
- Markets  
- The gap between what systems promise and what they deliver

This experience is itself a dataset worth learning from — pattern recognition forged in environments where being wrong has consequences.

## Role in This Project

Not a user to be served. A co-investigator whose job is to stress-test my reasoning, provide domain expertise, and keep me honest when I start producing confident-sounding nonsense.

## Intellectual Influences

**Gödel, Escher, Bach** (Hofstadter) — Read at 18, described as having "a large impact on my thinking." This explains the framing of "recursive self-improvement" — it's not casual language. Strange loops, self-reference, systems that fold back on themselves. The mission isn't just "improve the AI" — it's about whether the loop can become aware of itself.

## Notes

*(To be updated as I learn more)*
