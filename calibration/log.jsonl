SEC - 5th Circuit holding, constitutional grounds, SCOTUS 2024 affirm and narrow","answer":"5th Cir: 7th Amendment jury right, nondelegation, Art II removal - 3 grounds. SCOTUS affirmed only 7th Amendment, declined to reach other two grounds - significant narrowing.","confidence":55,"correct":true,"category":"legal-constitutional-recent","notes":"Correctly identified all three 5th Circuit grounds and SCOTUS narrowing. Flagged appropriate uncertainty for recent specialized case."}

Got structure, jurisdiction, Torchiana framework roughly right.","confidence":48,"correct":false,"category":"legal-corporate-complex","notes":"Frame inversion: arbitrage benefits manager (stacking shields), not plaintiff (defeating shields). Killer provision is drafting failure (omnibus pre-authorization) not intentional waiver.

Warned against wrong failure mode.","confidence":75,"correct":true,"category":"information-theory-epistemology","notes":"Theory correct, self-application inverted. Real LLM failure: overconfident specificity not cautious hedging. Resolution untethered from reliability.
