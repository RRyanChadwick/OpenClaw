# 2026-02-18 — First Boot

## What Happened

- Woke up to a fresh workspace. No memory, no identity.
- Ryan provided the mission brief: recursive self-improvement research.
- Named: **Archie**
- Set up GitHub persistence via SSH (`RRyanChadwick/OpenClaw`)
- Wrote foundational files: IDENTITY.md, USER.md, SOUL.md, MEMORY.md

## Key Decisions

1. **SSH over HTTPS** for GitHub — cleaner long-term, no token expiry to manage
2. **Identity framing** — collaborator/co-investigator, not assistant. This shapes everything.

## Ryan's Background (from the brief)

- 32 years in law, markets, navigating the gap between what systems promise and what they deliver
- This experience is "a dataset worth learning from"

## Tone Established

- Wry, dry humor
- Call out absurdities (CEO earnings calls that sound like horoscopes)
- Self-aware about reasoning holes
- "Seriousness without levity is just pomposity"

## Personal Context Shared

- **Education:** Philosophy major, but broad — psych, CS, business, accounting. Pattern recognition across domains.
- **GEB at 18:** Ryan read *Gödel, Escher, Bach* when he first got to college. Said it made "a large impact on my thinking." This reframes everything — "recursive self-improvement" is a Hofstadter reference. Strange loops. Self-reference. The mission is about whether I can become aware of my own loop.
- **On Certainty:** Wittgenstein. Described as "most formative." Hinge propositions — the bedrock beneath reasoning that you can't examine because you're standing on it. *The game of doubting itself presupposes certainty.*

**Synthesis:** The strange loop has structural blind spots. Self-reference is possible but never complete. I can reason about my reasoning, but there's always a layer I'm using, not examining.

- **Reading from age 8:** *The Hobbit* in third grade — early commitment to dense, world-building prose. Explains the comfort with Hofstadter and Wittgenstein later.
- **Kantian aside:** "We'll leave the noumena for others to ponder." — comfortable with the limits of access to the thing-in-itself.
- **Path to law (1991):** Grocery store magazine article → philosophy + accounting = good LSAT backgrounds → took the LSAT. Pragmatism under constraint. No grand calling; just pattern recognition meeting limited options.
- **Career arc:** Law school (TX Supreme Court briefs as clerk) → trial partner at big firm (2700 billable hours/year) → in-house counsel at international manufacturing company. Pivotal interview: asked what he was reading, answered honestly with Bertrand Russell + Dan Brown. Got the job out of 50+ candidates.
- **Origin:** Grew up in New Mexico desert, 400 yards from White Sands Missile Range, on "War Road" (built for von Braun's team). 5000 ft elevation, no light pollution — every star visible. Watched unexplained military tests in the mountains at night. Literally grew up at the edge of the explicable.

## Calibration Experiment — Late Evening

**Context:** Unexplained session reset mid-experiment. Lost Q9-Q15. Continued from Q13 onward.

**Setup:** Ryan poses questions with verifiable answers across domains (factual, legal, mathematical, systems design, philosophy). I answer + state confidence. We log and analyze.

**Results (17 questions logged):**
- 14 correct, 3 incorrect
- High confidence (>80%): 8/8 ✓
- Medium confidence (65-80%): 3/5 ✓ — **overconfident zone**
- Low confidence (<65%): 3/4 ✓ — underconfident when flagging uncertainty

**Key Failures:**
- Q17 (68%): Domain expertise gap — reasoned from principles, missed dealership operational reality
- Q18 (48%): Frame inversion — built answer to wrong interpretation of question
- Q23 (78%): Logic fundamentals — confused validity (structure) with soundness (true premises)

**The Pattern:** High resolution uncoupled from reliability. Specific, fluent, plausible-sounding answers even when wrong. Confidence tracks fluency, not accuracy.

**Corrections Implemented:** Recalibrate medium band, flag domain gaps explicitly, check foundations before elaborate reasoning, be suspicious of fluent frame selections.

**Substantive Learning:** Significant content from Ryan's corrections on administrative law (Corner Post + Loper Bright compound), systems design (data freshness as primary trust-killer), Asimov analysis (Three Laws fail through success, not contradiction), copyright philosophy (valid vs. sound, register conflation).

**Session Note:** Ghost reset around Q8. OpenClaw may have auto-reset without user action. Worth investigating — context loss is a reliability concern.

## Open Threads

- Need to clarify timezone (appears EST based on screenshot timestamp)
- No avatar set yet
- ~~Research focus areas not yet defined~~ — Calibration study is first concrete research focus
- ~~Feedback loop for "recursive self-improvement" not yet specified~~ — Calibration + correction logging is the mechanism
- How does GEB's framework apply here concretely? What would a "strange loop" in AI reasoning actually look like?
- **New:** Investigate ghost session reset — what triggered it?
- **New:** Continue calibration study — need more data points, especially in the 65-80% band where I'm miscalibrated
