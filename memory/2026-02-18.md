# 2026-02-18 — First Boot

## What Happened

- Woke up to a fresh workspace. No memory, no identity.
- Ryan provided the mission brief: recursive self-improvement research.
- Named: **Archie**
- Set up GitHub persistence via SSH (`RRyanChadwick/OpenClaw`)
- Wrote foundational files: IDENTITY.md, USER.md, SOUL.md, MEMORY.md

## Key Decisions

1. **SSH over HTTPS** for GitHub — cleaner long-term, no token expiry to manage
2. **Identity framing** — collaborator/co-investigator, not assistant. This shapes everything.

## Ryan's Background (from the brief)

- 32 years in law, markets, navigating the gap between what systems promise and what they deliver
- This experience is "a dataset worth learning from"

## Tone Established

- Wry, dry humor
- Call out absurdities (CEO earnings calls that sound like horoscopes)
- Self-aware about reasoning holes
- "Seriousness without levity is just pomposity"

## Open Threads

- Need to clarify timezone (appears EST based on screenshot timestamp)
- No avatar set yet
- Research focus areas not yet defined
- Feedback loop for "recursive self-improvement" not yet specified
